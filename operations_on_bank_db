--Fetch and display data from table--
select * from table deposit 
select loan_id, loan_amount  from loan;

-- Join---

select loan.cus_id,loan.branch_id,loan.loan_amount,deposit.deposit_amount
from loan
join
deposit
on loan.cus_id=deposit.cus_id;
--Other join - left join, right join to keep the data from only table 1 and table 2 respectively--

--Aggregate Function---
select cus_id,sum(loan_amount) as loan_amount from  loan group by cus_id;
select cus_id,count(loan_amount) as loan_count from  loan group by cus_id;
select cus_id,avg(loan_amount) as loan_average from  loan group by cus_id;
select cus_id,max(loan_amount) as loan_max_value from  loan group by cus_id;
select cus_id,min(loan_amount) as loan_max_value from  loan group by cus_id;

--Having vs where--
1. Having is always used with Aggregate function and grouping
-Having Problem-
select cus_id ,count(loan_amount) from (select cus_id, loan_amount from loan group by cus_id,loan_id having loan_amount >35000) as derived_table group by cus_id;

--view--
drop view if exists view1;
create view view1 as (select cus_id,sum(loan_amount) as TLA from loan group by cus_id);
create view view2 as (select cus_id,sum(deposit_amount) as TDA from deposit group by cus_id);
create view view3 as (select view1.cus_id,view1.tla,view2.tda from view1 join view2 on view1.cus_id=view2.cus_id);
select cus_id,tla,tda,(tda-tla) as credit from view3 order by view3.cus_id asc;

--Rank functions--
ROW_NUMBER() - select cus_id,loan_amount,row_number() over(order by loan_amount desc) Ranks from loan;
RANK()- select cus_id,loan_amount,rank() over(partition by cus_id order by loan_amount desc) Ranks from loan; -if two records have same value the two records are given with rank 1 and 3 rd record with rank 3
DENSE_RANK()-select cus_id,loan_amount,dense_rank() over(partition by cus_id order by loan_amount desc) Ranks from loan;-if two records have same value the two records are given with rank 1 and 3 rd record with rank 2
NTILE(3)-select cus_id,loan_amount,dense_rank() over(partition by cus_id order by loan_amount desc) Ranks from loan;-if two records have same value the two records are given with rank 1 and 3 rd record with rank 2


--lag()-before value--lead()-after value-
select loan_id,loan_amount, lag(loan_amount) over (order by loan_id) as previous from loan;

--Procedure--
CREATE PROCEDURE new_pro(name1 varchar(30), age1 int)
language sql
as
$$
  insert into table1 values (name1,age1)
$$

call new_pro('Gion',22)

select * from table1;

drop procedure new_pro(name1 varchar(30), age1 int);


SQL Practice:

1.Upper case
select upper(emp_name) from bank_employee;

2.fetch first 3 letters from name
select substring(emp_name,1,4) from bank_employee;

select upper(substring(emp_name,2,3))  from bank_employee;

3. To fetch current date
select current_date;

4. Text to columns or split
SELECT
    split_part(emp_address::TEXT,'(', 1) city,
    replace(split_part(emp_address::TEXT,'(', 2),')','') code
FROM
    bank_employee as temp1 ;
    
-copy tabl--
select * into bank_employee_copy from bank_employee;

--concat strings--
select emp_id,emp_name||' '||emp_address as full_name from bank_employee order by emp_id limit 9 ;
select concat(emp_name,' ',emp_address) as full_name from bank_employee order by emp_id limit 9 ;
